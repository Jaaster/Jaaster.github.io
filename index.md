## About me: 

Greetings! I'm Joriah (Joe-rye-ahh), 

I've been developing software for half-decade and am currently the lead iOS Developer at [Devsmen](./another-page.html). I specialize in Native iOS Development and App Design and am always looking to improve my already very developed iOS development skills. 

I've built a variety of Apps, ranging from Health and Fitness, Utilities, Social Networking, and just your "run in the mill" Apps.
